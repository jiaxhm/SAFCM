Super-Aware Fuzzy C-Means Clustering for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation

Abstract—The unsupervised fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm has been extensively and
successfully applied in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis for several decades.
 However, HSI contains a broad spectral range and complex spatial structures,
 resulting in a diverse pixel distribution. Consequently, traditional variations of
 fuzzy c-means clustering suffer from low segmentation accuracy. To address this
 issue, we propose super-aware fuzzy c-means clustering (SAFCM) for HSI segmen
tation, which innovatively integrates superpixel generation and segmentation into
 a single objective function. The SAFCM utilizes a spatial distance that combines
 color intensity and corresponding position coordinates to generate superpixels,
 which enhances the regularity of superpixels and improves immunity to cluttered
 pixels. Subsequently, the SAFCM employs superpixel features and corresponding
 histogram information for target segmentation, which accelerates the clustering
 process and refines segmentation accuracy. To validate the efficiency and effec
tiveness of the SAFCM, we conduct experiments on HSI data sets. These results
 demonstrate that the SAFCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.
